## Valuation Methodologies

### Comparable Company Analysis

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Public Comps">
    **Approach**: Value based on public company trading multiples

    **Relevant Comparables**:
    - Regenerative medicine companies (Fate Therapeutics, Sana Biotechnology)
    - Life science tools (Repligen, Bio-Techne)
    - Diagnostics (Guardant Health, Exact Sciences)
    - CROs (Charles River, Eurofins)

    **Key Multiples**:
    - EV/Revenue: 4-12x (depending on growth rate and profitability)
    - EV/EBITDA: 20-40x (for profitable companies)
    - P/E: 30-60x (mature, profitable)

    **Adjustments**:
    - Size discount (private, smaller companies): 15-30%
    - Liquidity discount: 20-30%
    - Growth premium: +20-50% for >100% growth

    **Application**: Most relevant for late-stage/pre-IPO valuations
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Precedent M&A">
    **Approach**: Value based on recent acquisition multiples

    **Recent Transactions**:
    - Corning / InSphero (undisclosed, estimated $150-200M)
    - Takara Bio / Definigen (undisclosed, estimated $80-120M)
    - Charles River / Organoid assets (undisclosed)

    **Typical Multiples**:
    - Revenue multiple: 3-6x for profitable companies
    - Strategic premium: 30-60% over standalone valuation
    - Synergy value (often captured by acquirer)

    **Factors Driving Premium**:
    - Strategic fit (complementary portfolio)
    - Competitive bidding
    - Unique assets (IP, customer base, biobanks)
    - Management retention requirements

    **Application**: Useful for all stages, especially if M&A exit likely
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Venture Comparables">
    **Approach**: Value based on recent venture financings in sector

    **Data Sources**:
    - PitchBook, CB Insights (financing data)
    - Company research (when disclosed)
    - Investor/advisor network intelligence

    **Typical Valuation Ranges** (2023-2024):
    - Seed/Series A: $15-50M post-money
    - Series B: $80-200M post-money
    - Series C: $250-600M post-money

    - Proprietary technology/IP
    - Strong customer traction
    - High growth rates (>100% YoY)
    - Multiple revenue streams
    - Strategic partnerships

    **Application**: Primary method for early/growth stage
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

**When Applicable**: Growth/late-stage companies with visibility to profitability

**Methodology**:
1. **Project Cash Flows** (5-10 years)
   - Revenue projections (application-by-application)
   - Margin assumptions (improving with scale)
   - Capex and working capital requirements
   - Free cash flow calculation

2. **Determine Discount Rate** (WACC)
   - Risk-free rate: ~4% (10-year Treasury)
   - Market risk premium: 6-8%
   - Beta: 1.5-2.0 (biotech/life sciences)
   - Resulting WACC: 13-20%

3. **Terminal Value**
   - Perpetuity growth method (2-3% perpetual growth)
   - Exit multiple method (8-12x EBITDA)

4. **Calculate NPV**
   - Discount cash flows and terminal value
   - Sum to enterprise value
   - Adjust for cash, debt, options

**Sensitivity Analysis**: Test multiple scenarios (revenue growth, margins, exit timing)

**Limitations**: Highly dependent on assumptions, less useful for early-stage

### Venture Capital Method

**When Applicable**: Early-stage companies without near-term profitability

**Methodology**:
1. **Estimate Exit Value** (5-10 years)
   - Revenue projection at exit: $50-200M
   - Exit multiple: 5-10x revenue (M&A typical)
   - Example: $100M revenue × 8x = $800M exit value

2. **Determine Required Return**
   - Series A: 10-15x target return
   - Series B: 5-8x target return
   - Series C: 3-5x target return

3. **Calculate Post-Money Valuation**
   - Exit value / Required return = Post-money valuation
   - Example: $800M / 10x = $80M post-money

4. **Adjust for Dilution**
   - Account for future financing rounds
   - Typical dilution: 30-50% from current to exit

**Advantages**: Simple, intuitive for venture investors

**Limitations**: Highly sensitive to exit value and return assumptions
