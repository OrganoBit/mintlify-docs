## The Drug Development Challenge

The pharmaceutical industry faces a critical productivity crisis:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="$2.6B+" icon="dollar-sign">
    Average cost to develop one new drug
  </Card>
  <Card title="10-15 years" icon="hourglass">

</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**The Predictivity Problem**: Animal models predict human efficacy only 50-60% of the time, leading to $50B+ annual waste in failed clinical trials
</Warning>

## How Organoids Address Drug Development Challenges

### The Value Proposition

Organoids offer a "Goldilocks" solution—more physiologically relevant than 2D cultures, more human-relevant than animal models, and more scalable than patient trials:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Better Predictivity">
    **Evidence**:
    - Tumor organoids predict patient drug responses with 80-88% accuracy
    - Liver organoids detect hepatotoxicity missed by animal models
    - Intestinal organoids replicate human-specific drug absorption

    **Impact**:
    - Reduce late-stage clinical failures (most expensive)
    - Earlier identification of safety issues
    - Better prioritization of lead compounds

    **ROI**: Estimated 20-30% reduction in overall drug development costs
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Human-Specific Biology">
    **Advantages**:
    - Human metabolism and drug transporters
    - Species-specific disease mechanisms
    - Human genetic diversity
    - Patient-specific responses

    **Examples**:
    - **TGN1412**: Catastrophic clinical trial but no animal toxicity; would have been detected in human organoids
    - **Hepatotoxicity**: Many drugs fail due to human-specific liver toxicity not seen in rodents
    - **COVID-19**: Human lung organoids essential as mice don't express correct ACE2 receptor

    **Validation**: Multiple studies showing organoid responses correlate better with human clinical outcomes than animal models
  </Tab>

    - Timeline: Days to weeks (vs months for animal studies)
    - Parallelization: Thousands of organoids simultaneously

    **Adoption**: Major pharma companies building high-throughput organoid screening platforms
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ethical & Regulatory">
    **Advantages**:
    - No animal welfare concerns
