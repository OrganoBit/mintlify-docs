## Introduction

Organoid technology is built upon decades of stem cell biology research. Understanding the fundamental principles of stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, and self-organization is essential to evaluating the scientific validity and commercial potential of organoid platforms.

<Note>
The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Shinya Yamanaka and John Gurdon for discovering that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, opening the door to patient-specific organoid generation.

## Self-Organization: The Key to Organoid Formation

### Principles of Self-Organization

Organoids form through intrinsic self-organizing properties of stem cells, without requiring external scaffolding or pre-patterning:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cell-Cell Signaling" icon="diagram-project">
    **Mechanism**: Cells communicate through secreted factors (morphogens) creating gradients that specify cell fate and position

    **Key Pathways**:
    - **Wnt signaling**: Stem cell maintenance, axis patterning
    - **BMP/TGFβ**: Mesoderm and endoderm specification
    - **FGF**: Cell proliferation and differentiation
    - **Notch**: Cell fate decisions, boundary formation

    **Example**: In intestinal organoids, Wnt gradient establishes crypt-villus axis with stem cells at high-Wnt regions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cell Polarity & Adhesion" icon="magnet">
    **Mechanism**: Cells establish apical-basal polarity and adhere to neighbors, forming epithelial structures

    **Key Molecules**:
    - **Cadherins**: Cell-cell adhesion
    - **Integrins**: Cell-matrix adhesion
    - **PAR proteins**: Polarity establishment
    - **Tight junctions**: Epithelial barrier formation

    **Example**: Brain organoids form ventricle-like structures with apical surfaces facing inward
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mechanical Forces" icon="gears">
    **Mechanism**: Physical forces (tension, compression) influence cell behavior and tissue shaping

    **Key Processes**:
    - **Actomyosin contractility**: Tissue folding and budding
    - **Hydraulic pressure**: Lumen formation
    - **ECM stiffness**: Differentiation cues
    - **Cell sorting**: Self-assembly by differential adhesion

    **Example**: Gut tube folding driven by differential cell contractility
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Genetic Programs" icon="dna">
    **Mechanism**: Intrinsic developmental programs encoded in the genome drive tissue-specific architecture

    **Key Elements**:
    - **Master regulators**: Transcription factors controlling organ identity
    - **Gene regulatory networks**: Complex feedback loops
    - **Epigenetic modifications**: Stable cell type specification
    - **Temporal control**: Developmental timing mechanisms

    **Example**: Intestinal organoids express Lgr5+ stem cells and all differentiated cell types through intrinsic programs
